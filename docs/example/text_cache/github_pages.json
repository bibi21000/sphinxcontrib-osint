The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-29)\nOn February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been [forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.\nThat same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub, [30] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.\n[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-31)In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.

GitHub also allows users to browse public [repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) are also available. In addition, the site provides [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [wiki software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software) called [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki)), and a [social network graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graph) to display how developers work on their versions (\"[forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.\nAnyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [review changes to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-67)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-68) [69] On April 14, 2020, GitHub made \"all of the core GitHub features\" free for everyone, including \"private repositories with unlimited collaborators.\"\n[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-70)The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) itself, written by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath, [71] Hyett, and Preston-Werner.\nScope.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)]\nThe primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and [issue tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \"committing\" and one instance of it is a \"commit.\" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\nIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\n- Documentation,\nincluding automatically rendered[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-72)[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)files in a variety of[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-like file formats (see[README \u00a7 On GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README#On_GitHub)) [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikis),with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content. These include curated lists of recommended software which have become known as awesome lists.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-73)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-75)- GitHub Codespaces, an.\n[online IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_IDE)providing users with a virtual machine intended to be a work environment to build and test code[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-76)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-78) - Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members.\n- Integrations Directory.\n[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-79) - Email notifications.\n[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-80) - Discussions.\n[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-81) - Option to subscribe someone to notifications by.\n[@ mentioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mention_(blogging))them.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-82) [Emojis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-83)- Nested.\n[task-lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_do_list)within files - Visualization of.\n[geospatial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_analysis)data - 3D render files can be previewed using an integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a \"3D canvas.\"\nThe viewer is powered by[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3d-84)[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)and[Three.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js). - Support for previewing many common image formats, including Photoshop's PSD files.\n- PDF document viewer.\n- Security Alerts of known.\n[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)in different packages.\nGitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Definition).

It can be run on an organization's hardware or a cloud provider and has been available as of November 2011.[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit) [86] In November 2020, source code for GitHub Enterprise Server was leaked online in an apparent protest against DMCA takedown of.\n[youtube-dl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl).

GitHub is integrated with.\n[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software))static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure.\n[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-92)Like the rest of GitHub, it includes free and paid service tiers. Websites generated through this service are hosted either as [subdomains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain) of the github.io domain or can be connected to custom [domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) bought through a third-party [domain name registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar). [93] GitHub Pages supports HTTPS encryption.\n[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-94)\n[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-95)GitHub Actions.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)]\nGitHub Actions was officially launched on November 13, 2019. It was first announced in October 2018 at GitHub Universe as a way to automate workflows, but the full general availability (GA) release came a year later in 2019. GitHub Actions, [96] which allows building.\n[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)and.\n[continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms. Unlike many other CI/CD tools, GitHub Actions launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting, deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem. GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for self-managed build servers.\nGist.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)]\nGitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects. [18] Tom Preston-Werner d\u00e9buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.\n[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-97)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each \"gist\" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-98)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-99)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \"split\" and \"unified\" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \"starred\", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)\nEducation program.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)]\nGitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [Bitnami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnami), [Crowdflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdflower), [DigitalOcean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean), DNSimple, [HackHands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackHands), [Namecheap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecheap), Orchestrate, Screenhero, [SendGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SendGrid), [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI), and [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) to launch the program.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\nIn 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program [102] to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.\nGitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.\n[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)GitHub Marketplace service.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)]\nGitHub also provides some [software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:\n- Waffle.io: project management for software teams, which allows users to automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across repositories.\n[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104) - Rollbar: provides real-time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting.\n[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-105)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-106) - Codebeat: automated code analysis for web and mobile developers.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI):[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)service.[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)- GitLocalize: provides utilities to manage project translation and internationalisation.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\nGitHub Sponsors.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)]\nGitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub. [107] The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations.\n[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge)said that GitHub Sponsors \"works exactly like.\n[Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon)\" because \"developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they'll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\" except with \"zero fees to use the program.\" Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.\n[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-108)\n[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-109)GitHub Archive Program.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)]\nIn July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site [60] in an abandoned mountain mine in.\n[Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard), Norway, part of the.\n[Arctic World Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_World_Archive)and not far from the.\n[Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault).

[114] In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.\n[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-115)\n[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NYTResigns-116)However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \"The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\"\n[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-117)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.\n[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-118)The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \"to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\"\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-119)\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-119)Sanctions.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)]\nOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [120] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in.\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and.\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-121)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for.\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[122]][[123]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)\nCensorship.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals.

This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \"The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \"nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\" [136] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE.

Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \"committing\" and one instance of it is a \"commit.\" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\nIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\n- Documentation,\nincluding automatically rendered[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-72)[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)files in a variety of[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-like file formats (see[README \u00a7 On GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README#On_GitHub)) [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikis),with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content.

GitHub Actions, [96] which allows building\n[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)and\n[continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms. Unlike many other CI/CD tools, GitHub Actions launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting, deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem. GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for self-managed build servers.\nGist\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)]\nGitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects. [18] Tom Preston-Werner d\u00e9buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.\n[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-97)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each \"gist\" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-98)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-99)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \"split\" and \"unified\" view.

The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.\nGitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.\n[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)GitHub Marketplace service\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)]\nGitHub also provides some [software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:\n- Waffle.io: project management for software teams, which allows users to automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across repositories.\n[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104) - Rollbar: provides real-time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting.\n[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-105)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-106) - Codebeat: automated code analysis for web and mobile developers.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI):[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)service.[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)- GitLocalize: provides utilities to manage project translation and internationalisation.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\nGitHub Sponsors\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)]\nGitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub.

[114] In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.\n[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-115)\n[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NYTResigns-116)However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \"The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\"\n[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-117)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.\n[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-118)The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \"to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\"\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-119)\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-119)Sanctions\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)]\nOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [120] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-121)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[122]][[123]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)\nCensorship\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals.

This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \"The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \"nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\" [136] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE.

[140] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of\n[performative activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_activism)and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.\nAn open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships.
