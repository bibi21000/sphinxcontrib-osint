[15] Tom Preston-Werner d\u00e9buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.\n[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each \""gist\"" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \""split\"" and \""unified\"" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \""starred\"", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on.

[123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in.\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and.\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for.\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)\nCensorship.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals.

This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \""The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\"" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \""nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\"" [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,\nfive workers had resigned over the contract.\n[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit)\n[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-140)\n[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-141)\n[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-142)The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision [to abandon \""master/slave\"" branch terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_(technology)#Controversy), spurred by the George Floyd protests and [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement. [143] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of.\n[performative activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_activism)and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.\nAn open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.\n[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-144)\n[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-145)Capitol riot comments and employee firing.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)]\nIn January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack), calling some of the rioters \""[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)\"".

GitHub also allows users to browse public [repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) are also available. In addition, the site provides [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [wiki software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software) called [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki)), and a [social network graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graph) to display how developers work on their versions (\""[forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\"") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.\nAnyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [review changes to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-71) [72] On April 14, 2020, GitHub made \""all of the core GitHub features\"" free for everyone, including \""private repositories with unlimited collaborators.\""\n[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-73)The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) itself, written by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath, [74] Hyett, and Preston-Werner.\nScope\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)]\nThe primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and [issue tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \""committing\"" and one instance of it is a \""commit.\"" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\nIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\n- Documentation,\nincluding automatically rendered[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-75)[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)files in a variety of[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-like file formats (see[README \u00a7 On GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README#On_GitHub)) [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikis),with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content.

GitHub is integrated with\n[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software))static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure.\n[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-95)Like the rest of GitHub, it includes free and paid service tiers. Websites generated through this service are hosted either as [subdomains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain) of the github.io domain or can be connected to custom [domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) bought through a third-party [domain name registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar).

It was first announced in October 2018 at GitHub Universe as a way to automate workflows, but the full general availability (GA) release came a year later in 2019. GitHub Actions, [99] which allows building\n[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)and\n[continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms. Unlike many other CI/CD tools, GitHub Actions launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting, deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem. GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for self-managed build servers.\nGist\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)]\nGitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects. [15] Tom Preston-Werner d\u00e9buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.\n[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each \""gist\"" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \""split\"" and \""unified\"" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \""starred\"", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)\nEducation program\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)]\nGitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services.

GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \""The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\""\n[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-120)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.\n[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-121)The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \""to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\""\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)Sanctions\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)]\nOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)\nCensorship\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals. [128] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,\nand GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.\n[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-129)On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro-\n[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-130)[ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS)content posted by users;\nthe block was lifted three days later.\n[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-131)On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country's energy minister.\n[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-132)\n[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-133)On March 26, 2015, a large-scale [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS) attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for just under five days. [134] The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of\n[circumventing Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_circumvention).\n[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-135)\n[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-136)\n[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-137)On April 19, 2020, Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei (volunteers for Terminus 2049, a project hosted on GitHub), and accused them of \""picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"" Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-138)\nICE contract\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)]\nGitHub has a $200,000 contract with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \""The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\"" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \""nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\"" [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,\nfive workers had resigned over the contract.\n[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit)\n[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-140)\n[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-141)\n[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-142)The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision [to abandon \""master/slave\"" branch terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_(technology)#Controversy), spurred by the George Floyd protests and [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement. [143] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of\n[performative activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_activism)and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.\nAn open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.\n[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-144)\n[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-145)Capitol riot comments and employee firing\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)]\nIn January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack), calling some of the rioters \""[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)\"". [146] After an investigation, GitHub's COO said there were \""significant errors of judgment and procedure\"" with the company's decision to fire the employee.

Because each \""gist\"" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \""split\"" and \""unified\"" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \""starred\"", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)\nEducation program.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)]\nGitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [Bitnami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnami), [Crowdflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdflower), [DigitalOcean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean), DNSimple, [HackHands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackHands), [Namecheap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecheap), Orchestrate, Screenhero, [SendGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SendGrid), [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI), and [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) to launch the program.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104)\nIn 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program [105] to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.\nGitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.\n[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-106)GitHub Marketplace service.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)]\nGitHub also provides some [software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:\n- Waffle.io: project management for software teams, which allows users to automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across repositories.\n[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-107) - Rollbar: provides real-time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting.\n[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-108)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-109) - Codebeat: automated code analysis for web and mobile developers.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI):[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)service.[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)- GitLocalize: provides utilities to manage project translation and internationalisation.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\nGitHub Sponsors.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)]\nGitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub. [110] The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations.\n[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge)said that GitHub Sponsors \""works exactly like.\n[Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon)\"" because \""developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they'll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\"" except with \""zero fees to use the program.\"" Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.\n[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-111)\n[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-112)GitHub Copilot.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)]\nGitHub Copilot was one of the first widely adopted [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI)-assisted software development tools. The preview launched in 2021 for [VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSCode) users and was based on [Open AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_AI)'s Codex model.\nGitHub Copilot is now available to use on GitHub.com directly, on the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line), as well as in several [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Users are able to choose from a range of [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLM) for some features.\nGitHub Archive Program.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)]\nIn July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site [63] in an abandoned mountain mine in.\n[Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard), Norway, part of the.\n[Arctic World Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_World_Archive)and not far from the.\n[Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault). The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories. The 21.\n[TB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte)of data was stored on.\npiqlFilmarchival film reels as.\n[matrix (2D) barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Matrix_(2D)_barcodes)(\n[Boxing barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_barcode)), and is expected to last 500\u20131,000 years.\n[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-113)\n[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-114)\n[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-115)\n[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-buried-116)The GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica, in an attempt to store all public repositories for 10,000 years. It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of [quartz glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_glass) platters, using a high-precision [petahertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petahertz) pulse laser, i.e. one that pulses a [quadrillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrillion) (1,000,000,000,000,000) times per second.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-buried-116)\nControversies.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)]\nHarassment allegations.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)]\nIn March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner engaged in a pattern of [harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment) against her that led to her leaving the company. [117] In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.\n[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-118)\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NYTResigns-119)However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \""The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\""\n[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-120)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.\n[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-121)The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \""to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\""\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)Sanctions.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)]\nOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in.\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and.\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for.\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)\nCensorship.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals. [128] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,\nand GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.\n[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-129)On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro-\n[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-130)[ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS)content posted by users;\nthe block was lifted three days later.\n[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-131)On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country's energy minister.\n[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-132)\n[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-133)On March 26, 2015, a large-scale [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS) attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for just under five days. [134] The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of.\n[circumventing Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_circumvention).\n[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-135)\n[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-136)\n[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-137)On April 19, 2020, Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei (volunteers for Terminus 2049, a project hosted on GitHub), and accused them of \""picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"" Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-138)\nICE contract.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)]\nGitHub has a $200,000 contract with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \""The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\"" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \""nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\"" [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,\nfive workers had resigned over the contract.\n[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit)\n[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-140)\n[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-141)\n[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-142)The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision [to abandon \""master/slave\"" branch terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_(technology)#Controversy), spurred by the George Floyd protests and [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement. [143] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of.\n[performative activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_activism)and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.\nAn open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.\n[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-144)\n[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-145)Capitol riot comments and employee firing.\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)]\nIn January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack), calling some of the rioters \""[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)\"".

GitHub also allows users to browse public [repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) are also available. In addition, the site provides [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [wiki software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software) called [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki)), and a [social network graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graph) to display how developers work on their versions (\""[forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))\"") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.\nAnyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [review changes to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project).

Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \""committing\"" and one instance of it is a \""commit.\"" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\nIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\n- Documentation,\nincluding automatically rendered[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-75)[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)files in a variety of[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-like file formats (see[README \u00a7 On GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README#On_GitHub)) [Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikis),with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content.

Unlike many other CI/CD tools, GitHub Actions launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting, deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem. GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for self-managed build servers.\nGist\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)]\nGitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects. [15] Tom Preston-Werner d\u00e9buted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.\n[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each \""gist\"" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\nUnregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)\nGists' [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a \""split\"" and \""unified\"" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, \""starred\"", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)\nEducation program\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)]\nGitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [Bitnami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnami), [Crowdflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdflower), [DigitalOcean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean), DNSimple, [HackHands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackHands), [Namecheap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecheap), Orchestrate, Screenhero, [SendGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SendGrid), [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI), and [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) to launch the program.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104)\nIn 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program [105] to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.\nGitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.\n[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-106)GitHub Marketplace service\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)]\nGitHub also provides some [software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:\n- Waffle.io: project management for software teams, which allows users to automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across repositories.\n[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-107) - Rollbar: provides real-time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting.\n[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-108)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-109) - Codebeat: automated code analysis for web and mobile developers.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI):[continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)service.[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)- GitLocalize: provides utilities to manage project translation and internationalisation.\n[][citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\nGitHub Sponsors\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)]\nGitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub. [110] The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations.\n[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge)said that GitHub Sponsors \""works exactly like\n[Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon)\"" because \""developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they'll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\"" except with \""zero fees to use the program.\"" Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.\n[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-111)\n[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-112)GitHub Copilot\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)]\nGitHub Copilot was one of the first widely adopted [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI)-assisted software development tools. The preview launched in 2021 for [VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSCode) users and was based on [Open AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_AI)'s Codex model.\nGitHub Copilot is now available to use on GitHub.com directly, on the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line), as well as in several [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Users are able to choose from a range of [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLM) for some features.\nGitHub Archive Program\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)]\nIn July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site [63] in an abandoned mountain mine in\n[Svalbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard), Norway, part of the\n[Arctic World Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_World_Archive)and not far from the\n[Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault). The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories. The 21\n[TB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte)of data was stored on\npiqlFilmarchival film reels as\n[matrix (2D) barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Matrix_(2D)_barcodes)(\n[Boxing barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_barcode)), and is expected to last 500\u20131,000 years.\n[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-113)\n[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-114)\n[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-115)\n[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-buried-116)The GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica, in an attempt to store all public repositories for 10,000 years. It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of [quartz glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_glass) platters, using a high-precision [petahertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petahertz) pulse laser, i.e. one that pulses a [quadrillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrillion) (1,000,000,000,000,000) times per second.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-buried-116)\nControversies\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)]\nHarassment allegations\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)]\nIn March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner engaged in a pattern of [harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment) against her that led to her leaving the company. [117] In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.\n[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-118)\n[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NYTResigns-119)However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, \""The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office.\""\n[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-120)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.\n[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-121)The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings \""to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\""\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)\n[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-122)Sanctions\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)]\nOn July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in\n[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),\n[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),\n[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),\n[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and\n[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.\nHowever, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:\n[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for\n[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]\nDevelopers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)\nCensorship\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)]\nOn December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals. [128] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,\nand GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.\n[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-129)On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro-\n[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-130)[ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS)content posted by users;\nthe block was lifted three days later.\n[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-131)On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country's energy minister.\n[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-132)\n[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-133)On March 26, 2015, a large-scale [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS) attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for just under five days. [134] The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of\n[circumventing Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_circumvention).\n[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-135)\n[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-136)\n[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-137)On April 19, 2020, Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei (volunteers for Terminus 2049, a project hosted on GitHub), and accused them of \""picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"" Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-138)\nICE contract\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)]\nGitHub has a $200,000 contract with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, \""The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company.\"" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to \""nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).\"" [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,\nfive workers had resigned over the contract.\n[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit)\n[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-140)\n[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-141)\n[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-142)The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision [to abandon \""master/slave\"" branch terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_(technology)#Controversy), spurred by the George Floyd protests and [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) movement. [143] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of\n[performative activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_activism)and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.\nAn open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.\n[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-144)\n[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-145)Capitol riot comments and employee firing\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)]\nIn January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the [January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack), calling some of the rioters \""[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)\"".

See all dispatches. world of software, and in particular free and open software. Github, the reference platform for developers around the world, was bought by the American net giant Microsoft, known for its software suite -For\u00e9e- Windows. After several days of rumors, the Redmond firm confirmed the acquisition, for an amount of $ 7.5 billion (6.4 billion euros). The transaction must be carried out by Microsoft actions and should be finalized at the end of the year after the green light from the regulatory authorities. Created in 2008, Github is certainly not very well known to the general public, but it still claims more than 28 million users worldwide. Bible of developers, it is a platform that allows them to publish and share, in a completely open way if they wish, the code they have created. Github is now hosting more than 80 million projects: software of course, but also any other computer program (site, mobile application), without limitation of programming language. Opening and the spirit of sharing that reigns in its community of users have logically transformed Github into one of the flagship platforms of supporters of free software. The latter promote the transparency of software thanks to the publication of the entire source code, which allows anyone to have access to it, to be able to modify it to enrich it, or to use certain parts to create another software. With free software, a user can for example adapt the program to the use he makes of it, which offers him flexibility. Free software is also supported by defenders of freedoms on the net because its transparency is deemed democratic -Chacun can understand the actions and decisions of the program -. It is also considered to be safer, because developers can identify if the code has been altered by a stolen door - a flaw used in particular by intelligence services - or a cybercriminal. So, the culture of free claims transparency, sharing and often free. It is opposed with most players in the software industry, who create and market owner or closed software, that is to say, the source code of which is kept secret to prevent us from copying or modifying it. Microsoft, the third world market capitalization behind Apple and Amazon, is the largest symbol with its owner suite Windows, which has made its richness. The announcing of Github's buyout by Microsoft therefore gives some cold sweats in the world of free software, both disappointed and worried. His supporters fear that the giant of Redmond does not distort the concept of Github, in particular his collaborative approach, that he locks his flexibility of use or that he is trying to take advantage of it. In a press release, Microsoft wanted to be reassuring. For the American company, the acquisition will allow developers to have new tools at each stage of software development, which will allow them to provide new services to their users:\nShould we see in this redemption the destruction of a symbol of free software, or on the contrary its recognition by one of the major players in the software industry? In recent years, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has been changing the group to the cloud and artificial intelligence, and has multiplied the statements favorable to the development of free software. Even if Windows and the services in the cloud -Logiciales and accommodation - draw most of the group's income, Microsoft has thus started a rapprochement to the culture of free software. It offers for example the operating system open Linux. To read also. The most read projects."",

GitHub, la plateforme de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence des d\u00e9veloppeurs du monde entier, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rachet\u00e9e par le g\u00e9ant du Net am\u00e9ricain Microsoft, connu pour sa suite logicielle -ferm\u00e9e- Windows. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs jours de rumeurs, la firme de Redmond a confirm\u00e9 le rachat, pour un montant de 7,5 milliards de dollars (6,4 milliards d'euros). La transaction doit s'effectuer par des actions Microsoft et devrait \u00eatre finalis\u00e9e en fin d'ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le feu vert des autorit\u00e9s r\u00e9glementaires.\nCr\u00e9\u00e9e en 2008, GitHub n'est certes pas tr\u00e8s connu du grand public, mais il revendique tout de m\u00eame plus de 28 millions d'utilisateurs dans le monde. Bible des d\u00e9veloppeurs, il s'agit d'une plateforme qui leur permet de publier et de partager, de mani\u00e8re totalement ouverte s'ils le souhaitent, le code qu'ils ont cr\u00e9\u00e9. GitHub h\u00e9berge aujourd'hui plus de 80 millions de projets : des logiciels bien s\u00fbr, mais aussi n'importe quel autre programme informatique (site, application mobile), sans limitation de langage de programmation.\nSon ouverture et l'esprit de partage qui r\u00e8gne dans sa communaut\u00e9 d'utilisateurs ont logiquement transform\u00e9 GitHub en l'une des plateformes phares des partisans du logiciel libre. Ces derniers promeuvent la transparence des logiciels gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la publication de l'enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du code source, ce qui permet \u00e0 n'importe qui d'y avoir acc\u00e8s, de pouvoir le modifier pour l'enrichir, ou d'en utiliser certaines parties pour cr\u00e9er un autre logiciel. Avec un logiciel libre, un utilisateur peut par exemple adapter le programme \u00e0 l'utilisation qu'il en fait, ce qui lui offre de la souplesse. Le logiciel libre est \u00e9galement soutenu par les d\u00e9fenseurs des libert\u00e9s sur le Net car sa transparence est jug\u00e9e d\u00e9mocratique -chacun peut comprendre les actions et d\u00e9cisions du programme-. Il est aussi consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme plus s\u00fbr, car les d\u00e9veloppeurs peuvent rep\u00e9rer si le code a \u00e9t\u00e9 alt\u00e9r\u00e9 par une porte d\u00e9rob\u00e9e -une faille utilis\u00e9e notamment par les services de renseignement- ou un cybercriminel.\nAinsi, la culture du libre revendique des valeurs de transparence, de partage et souvent de gratuit\u00e9. Elle s'oppose avec la plupart des acteurs de l'industrie du logiciel, qui cr\u00e9ent et commercialisent des logiciels propri\u00e9taires ou ferm\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire dont le code source est gard\u00e9 secret pour \u00e9viter qu'on puisse le copier ou le modifier. Microsoft, troisi\u00e8me capitalisation boursi\u00e8re mondiale derri\u00e8re Apple et Amazon, en est le plus grand symbole avec sa suite propri\u00e9taire Windows, qui a fait sa richesse.\nL'annonce du rachat de GitHub par Microsoft donne donc quelques sueurs froides au monde du logiciel libre, \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9\u00e7u et inquiet. Ses partisans redoutent que le g\u00e9ant de Redmond ne d\u00e9nature le concept de GitHub, notamment son approche collaborative, qu'il verrouille sa souplesse d'utilisation ou qu'il cherche \u00e0 en tirer profit.\nDans un communiqu\u00e9, Microsoft s'est voulu rassurant. Pour l'entreprise am\u00e9ricaine, l'acquisition va permettre aux d\u00e9veloppeurs de disposer de nouveaux outils \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape de d\u00e9veloppement d'un logiciel, ce qui leur permettra de fournir de nouveaux services \u00e0 leurs utilisateurs:\nFaut-il voir dans ce rachat la destruction d'un symbole du logiciel libre, ou au contraire sa reconnaissance par l'un des acteurs majeurs de l'industrie du logiciel ? Depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, Satya Nadella, le Pdg de Microsoft, effectue une mutation du groupe vers le cloud et l'intelligence artificielle, et a multipli\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations favorables au d\u00e9veloppement du logiciel libre. M\u00eame si Windows et les services dans le cloud -logiciels et h\u00e9bergement- tirent l'essentiel des revenus du groupe, Microsoft a ainsi amorc\u00e9 un rapprochement vers la culture du logiciel libre.

  ""text"": ""If you boil it down to the most basic difference between GitHub and Bitbucket, it is that GitHub is focused around public code and Bitbucket is for private. GitHub has a huge open-source community and Bitbucket tends to have mostly enterprise and business users.\nBitbucket vs Github: Two of the largest source code management services for development projects, offering a variety of deployment models from fully cloud-based to on-premise. Historically, they have taken different approaches to private vs. public repositories that affected the ease of collaboration and the risk of [data exposure](https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-are-cloud-leaks).\nA Github account is the calling card of the software developer. Just as any writer would be asked to show their blog, every developer is expected to produce examples of their code on GitHub. But that does not necessarily make GitHub the best choice for software development teams. GitHub thrives on making code easy to share, and in that regard is indispensable for the open-source backbone of the internet as we know it. At the same time, that means organizations must take greater care to manage their users and [access control](https://www.upguard.com/blog/access-control) settings to ensure they are not compromising their [cyber resilience](https://www.upguard.com/about/resilience). The pricing models of the two products likewise reflects their differing approaches to how to best manage version control.\nBitbucket supports Git, but the situation has changed when it comes to other repository types. Bitbucket\u2019s advantage over GitHub used to be that both Git and Mercurial repository hosting were available with Bitbucket. There was never support for SVN, however, Bitbucket\u2019s modernisation has come at the expense of support for Mercurial. Bitbucket is written in Python and uses the Django web framework.\nBitbucket was launched in 2008, in Australia, and was originally an independent startup offering hosting only for Mercurial projects. It was acquired in 2010 by fellow Australian company Atlassian, and about a year later added support for Git repos.\nMany users who are worried about keeping code private have migrated over to Bitbucket from GitHub following Microsoft\u2019s recent acquisition of the platform for $7.5bn.\nNote: Mercurial support will be removed from Bitbucket on June 1, 2020. Read more about [Atlassian's decision to focus on Git](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket#targetText=After%20much%20consideration%2C%20we've,get%20migration%20resources%20and%20support.).\nBitbucket integrates very well with JIRA, originally built as a bug tracker, but is so flexible now it can be used for: bug tracking, issue tracking, service desks and project management. This is no surprise given that JIRA is also an Atlassian product. Other features are:\nThe pricing structure differs from Git\u2019s in that Bitbucket charges per user whereas Git charges per repository. Bitbucket allows unlimited public repos for all, but also an unlimited number of private repositories for free for up to 5 users. Beyond that, [pricing is tiered as per the table](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing?tab=self-managed) below:\nThe Bitbucket Data Center Edition goes up to 30,000 users for $792,000 per year. If you are interested in extensive pricing, [click here](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing?tab=self-managed).\nAs the name of the plan implies, the server plan is hosted on a company\u2019s own server and requires a one-time payment.\nFirst of all, GitHub only hosts projects that use the Git version control system (VCS). That\u2019s it. Nothing else. But Git is far and away the most commonly used VCS, so GitHub is still the largest code host of them all, with now over 100 million repositories of code.\nGitHub.com was originally started in 2008, with the platform written in both Ruby and Erlang. GitHub is designed to encourage close communication and collaboration within development teams. To this end it includes features like highlighted code comments and collaborative code review. Other notable [features](https://github.com/features) are listed below.\n[GitHub pricing](https://github.com/pricing) is free for public repos and as of January 2019, like Bitbucket, offers free unlimited private repositories. For private repositories, GitHub allows unlimited numbers of collaborators grouped into the following paid plans. The Team plans allow a central administrator who manages teams and can set varying levels of permissions. There is also [GitHub Enterprise, a version tailored for large organizations](https://enterprise.github.com/) which offers cloud-based and on-premise deployment options.\nAs an aside, in early 2014 GitHub was the setting of an ugly case of employee harassment. A female software engineer called Julie Ann Horvath came forward with revelations of a discriminatory and generally female-unfriendly environment at GitHub. She also reported being harassed and intimidated by an at-first unnamed wife of a GitHub founder, made worse by the tacit approval and support of the wife\u2019s bullying antics by the founder himself. These individuals were later revealed to be GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa. The negative publicity that ensued resulted in Preston-Werner first being suspended then resigning from his role in GitHub\u2019s management team, and his wife no longer allowed into the company\u2019s offices. CEO Chris Wanstrath offered a public apology to Horvath for what she went through at the company; GitHub also launched an investigation which rejected Horvath\u2019s accusations of \u201cgender-based discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or abuse.\u201d This history bears mentioning in part because [hostile workplaces not only drive away talent, they increase](https://www.upguard.com/blog/why-ceo-approval-matters-for-security-ratings) [cybersecurity risk](https://www.upguard.com/blog/cybersecurity-risk)\u2013 risk for lost time, legal penalties, reputational damage, and data exposure. Read more about the whole sordid saga [here](https://github.blog/2014-04-21-results-of-the-github-investigation/), [here](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/) and [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/github-puts-founder-on-leave-kicks-wife-out-of-office-after-harassment-claim/).\nThe widespread use of GitHub by small developers for hosting their code has resulted in a well-tested platform that has one of the best user experience in the open-source community. Bitbucket, which did not start out with such a heavy focus on open source, and saw lower usage, has struggled at times with an interface that was seen as more complex to navigate than what GitHub offers. In recent times, though, this has changed. Bitbucket now draws rave reviews for its user experience. Its online editor is among the best for editing code directly online without checking it out onto your machine first. While not being the simplest platform to use, it\u2019s powerful and versatile, with plenty of features to support the needs of small businesses and enterprises who have long been heavy users of the platform. The Bitbucket interface is centered around the \u201cYour Work Dashboard,\u201d which gives you easy access to your repositories and pull requests. Bitbucket offers a fully-fledged Git interface and supports everything from filtering pull requests to issue tracking, management of SSH keys, and other features.\nGitHub has a simple interface that is friendly even for beginners to Git and online source code hosting. The platform has long been open-source friendly and packs a UI that provides access to Git\u2019s underlying features as well as providing some of its own. That said, there are scenarios where you will still need to know how to use Git at the command line, especially if you are managing large open source projects with complex merging requirements.\nGitHub lets you easily see and review commits by collaborators, with online diff features, so you can manage code at a granular level. The interface also offers excellent support for collaborative code review, highly useful for working in teams, tracking, and management of tasks, as well as DevOps features like CI/CD. Through its other tools such as GitHub Desktop, GitHub lets you expand the range of features you can use for managing your Git code collaboration still further.\nDeveloper adoption and community reach is one area where Bitbucket and GitHub have experienced diverging fortunes. Lacking the dominant position in open source that GitHub has long enjoyed, Bitbucket continues to play second fiddle to GitHub in terms of the number of users. However, its community has recorded impressive growth over the last several years.\nBitbucket now boasts [more than 10 million registered](https://bitbucket.org/blog/celebrating-10-million-bitbucket-cloud-registered-users) users, which, while not enough to supplant GitHub, which has been growing for its part as well, makes Bitbucket firmly one of the leaders in the online Git code hosting marketplace. Since the company\u2019s founding in 2008, its commitment to help companies write code, test software, and collaborate, has seen it grow to a level where it can claim that 60 of the Fortune 100 corporations use Bitbucket every single day. While it might have a smaller community than GitHub, Bitbucket is also notable for its plethora of integrations, which means its community can access tools like Slack, AWS, Datadog, and JFrog just as well as those developers using GitHub.\nGitHub\u2019s community is far more impressive, especially when it comes to its reputation in the open-source community. To be a credible open source project or open-source developer, it\u2019s almost a de facto standard that your code must be hosted and publicly available on GitHub. GitHub\u2019s user base now consists of [over 40 million registered users](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/14/github-launches-android-app-in-beta/), with over 100 million Git repositories hosted on the platform. GitHub\u2019s community is active in 200 countries and is a significant driver in the platform\u2019s preeminence in the tech world. This sizable community also drives business value and might have been a factor in [Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) back in 2018. While Microsoft and the open-source world had [long been at odds](https://jacquesmattheij.com/what-is-wrong-with-microsoft-buying-github/), the partnership between GitHub and Microsoft does give GitHub new-found credibility with enterprise customers, and Microsoft new-found credibility with open source developers and software users. Needless to say, the GitHub community, which already counts a good share of Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 companies, could continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the years ahead.\nIn addition to working with source code, both Bitbucket and GitHub serve as collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. Wikis and other tools for collaboration, built right into the platforms, help teams work collaboratively on ideas that form part of the intellectual space of the code. In Bitbucket, you get a wiki when you create a code repository. Bitbucket wikis can be edited and version controlled, and many projects also use them as project home pages.\nBitbucket offers plenty of other features that facilitate team collaboration, including side by side diffs, IDE integrations, and the ability to organize repositories into projects.\nGitHub also offers a plethora of collaboration features, with its history of facilitating very large open-source projects bearing testimony to the robustness of tools supporting collaboration on the platform. To name a few, some of the projects with the most influential collaborator networks and highest numbers of contributors include:\nThe GitHub workflow, with simple cloning, repository forking, branching, pull requests, merging, diffs, and more, makes this one of the best platforms for teams looking to work on code together, whether open source or not. GitHub also comes with support for wikis to document your project and share information with your team. Wikis are available for GitHub Free, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Wikis can be written in Markdown or other supported formats. Just as with source code, wikis are visible publicly for public repos, and limited to team members for private projects.\nOne of the chief selling points for Atlassian\u2019s Bitbucket is that it integrates extremely well with the Atlassian suite of developer tools, and these tools have considerable usage and are popular among developers. This is certainly true, and should be a factor in your consideration, however, note that GitHub has been making moves to buttress its products with similar features, and also integrates well with the Atlassian suite of developer tools.\nBitbucket integrates well with Jira, Atlassian\u2019s issue tracker software, and Trello, the project management tool that\u2019s popular among many software and business teams. In addition, there are more than 50 integrations with other commonly used developer tools available for developers and teams hosting their repositories on Bitbucket. These include:\nWith integrations, you are able to view metrics from these services and tools right inside Bitbucket, as well as managing aspects of your software or DevOps infrastructure right alongside the code.\nIf you do end up going with GitHub, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the integrations available for both Trello and Jira are very capable. In 2018, [GitHub announced it had been working with](https://github.blog/2018-10-04-announcing-the-new-github-and-jira-software-cloud-integration/) Jira to create an integration allowing enhanced features for connecting your GitHub code to Jira Software Cloud. Trello also has a GitHub Power Up integration that allows you to attach GitHub pull requests to Trello cards. Managing your GitHub work in Trello should be a breeze thanks to this integration. However, GitHub has been making moves to enhance its own product with Trello-like features. Back in 2016, for example, [GitHub launched \u201cProjects,](https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/github-launches-a-trello-competitor-pull-request-reviews-redesigned-profile-pages/)\u201d a feature allowing Trello-like cards to manage tasks and code projects.\nGitHub also has [integrations available](https://github.com/marketplace) for a wide range of popular developer tools and software products. A Slack integration is available for team chat, for example, as well as integrations with Codefresh and Semaphore for continuous integration. Monitoring integrations available include LogRocket and Waydev. In the project management category, integrations with GitKraken Glo Boards and DeepAffects are available, among plenty more useful integrations in multiple categories.\nGiven that both Bitbucket and GitHub are among the giants in the Git repository hosting space, it\u2019s likely they will continue to offer the widest sets of integrations with other popular code tools. A notable exception here is the [2020 dropping of Mercurial](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket) from Bitbucket\u2019s source code hosting services. GitHub never supported this VCS, but Bitbucket, for many years, did. However, due to the low numbers of Mercurial users, it has met a final demise on Bitbucket\u2019s platform and will not be supported in the future.\nThey may be the most visible and reputable Git hosting platforms available to developers today, but the popularity of Bitbucket and GitHub does not mean they are the only viable platforms available to you. Some low key longtime players have always been chugging along in the background and may receive more attention now that Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of GitHub, and other changes, have at least a small number of open-source developers asking questions.\nSince its appearance on the scene in 2011, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) has become a notable competitor to both GitHub and Bitbucket. Over the years, it has gone from offering source code management to a full DevOps lifecycle product. To quote the company\u2019s own web page, \u201cFrom project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application.\u201d.\n[LaunchPad](https://launchpad.net/) is the software collaboration management platform used by Canonical, makers of the Ubuntu Linux distro and related software. Canonical is one of the big names in the open-source movement and its software management platform, with support for both Git and Bazaar, will be a great solution if you are working on open source code.\nAnother notable platform in the open-source world, [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) allows open source developers to host their code and distribute their software and downloads through the platform. It also has tools to import GitHub repositories along with related data such as wikis.\nThere are many other Git source code management and collaboration platforms that your team can use to develop software. Some notable ones to look at are [Google Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories) and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/). These tools also integrate well into cloud computing resources offered by their respective providers, Google and Amazon.\nBitbucket and GitHub are very closely matched in terms of features and either will be sufficient code repository hosting services if you need to use Git and or need a simple personal account. Both now have unlimited free private repositories. And if your version control system (VCS) is Mercurial, then it\u2019s only Bitbucket for you. Unfortunately, neither supports SVN, which remains popular. Each has some useful features not found in the other, such as GitHub pages for small web-hosting projects, or Bitbucket\u2019s JIRA integration.\nThe choice may come down to the structures of your projects. If you have many private projects and small numbers of users per project, Bitbucket may be a cheaper option because of its per-repo pricing. If you have large teams collaborating on just a few projects, GitHub may be the better option. The free plan offered by Bitbucket and GitHub is aimed at solo developers and small teams.\nSee how [UpGuard can help secure GitHub repositories](https://www.upguard.com/demo) and prevent dangerous data exposures.\nApart from pricing, the summary comparison table below may also help you in your decision:"",

  ""text_orig"": ""If you boil it down to the most basic difference between GitHub and Bitbucket, it is that GitHub is focused around public code and Bitbucket is for private. GitHub has a huge open-source community and Bitbucket tends to have mostly enterprise and business users.\nBitbucket vs Github: Two of the largest source code management services for development projects, offering a variety of deployment models from fully cloud-based to on-premise. Historically, they have taken different approaches to private vs. public repositories that affected the ease of collaboration and the risk of [data exposure](https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-are-cloud-leaks).\nA Github account is the calling card of the software developer. Just as any writer would be asked to show their blog, every developer is expected to produce examples of their code on GitHub. But that does not necessarily make GitHub the best choice for software development teams. GitHub thrives on making code easy to share, and in that regard is indispensable for the open-source backbone of the internet as we know it. At the same time, that means organizations must take greater care to manage their users and [access control](https://www.upguard.com/blog/access-control) settings to ensure they are not compromising their [cyber resilience](https://www.upguard.com/about/resilience). The pricing models of the two products likewise reflects their differing approaches to how to best manage version control.\nBitbucket supports Git, but the situation has changed when it comes to other repository types. Bitbucket\u2019s advantage over GitHub used to be that both Git and Mercurial repository hosting were available with Bitbucket. There was never support for SVN, however, Bitbucket\u2019s modernisation has come at the expense of support for Mercurial. Bitbucket is written in Python and uses the Django web framework.\nBitbucket was launched in 2008, in Australia, and was originally an independent startup offering hosting only for Mercurial projects. It was acquired in 2010 by fellow Australian company Atlassian, and about a year later added support for Git repos.\nMany users who are worried about keeping code private have migrated over to Bitbucket from GitHub following Microsoft\u2019s recent acquisition of the platform for $7.5bn.\nNote: Mercurial support will be removed from Bitbucket on June 1, 2020. Read more about [Atlassian's decision to focus on Git](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket#targetText=After%20much%20consideration%2C%20we've,get%20migration%20resources%20and%20support.).\nBitbucket integrates very well with JIRA, originally built as a bug tracker, but is so flexible now it can be used for: bug tracking, issue tracking, service desks and project management. This is no surprise given that JIRA is also an Atlassian product. Other features are:\nThe pricing structure differs from Git\u2019s in that Bitbucket charges per user whereas Git charges per repository. Bitbucket allows unlimited public repos for all, but also an unlimited number of private repositories for free for up to 5 users. Beyond that, [pricing is tiered as per the table](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing?tab=self-managed) below:\nThe Bitbucket Data Center Edition goes up to 30,000 users for $792,000 per year. If you are interested in extensive pricing, [click here](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing?tab=self-managed).\nAs the name of the plan implies, the server plan is hosted on a company\u2019s own server and requires a one-time payment.\nFirst of all, GitHub only hosts projects that use the Git version control system (VCS). That\u2019s it. Nothing else. But Git is far and away the most commonly used VCS, so GitHub is still the largest code host of them all, with now over 100 million repositories of code.\nGitHub.com was originally started in 2008, with the platform written in both Ruby and Erlang. GitHub is designed to encourage close communication and collaboration within development teams. To this end it includes features like highlighted code comments and collaborative code review. Other notable [features](https://github.com/features) are listed below.\n[GitHub pricing](https://github.com/pricing) is free for public repos and as of January 2019, like Bitbucket, offers free unlimited private repositories. For private repositories, GitHub allows unlimited numbers of collaborators grouped into the following paid plans. The Team plans allow a central administrator who manages teams and can set varying levels of permissions. There is also [GitHub Enterprise, a version tailored for large organizations](https://enterprise.github.com/) which offers cloud-based and on-premise deployment options.\nAs an aside, in early 2014 GitHub was the setting of an ugly case of employee harassment. A female software engineer called Julie Ann Horvath came forward with revelations of a discriminatory and generally female-unfriendly environment at GitHub. She also reported being harassed and intimidated by an at-first unnamed wife of a GitHub founder, made worse by the tacit approval and support of the wife\u2019s bullying antics by the founder himself. These individuals were later revealed to be GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa. The negative publicity that ensued resulted in Preston-Werner first being suspended then resigning from his role in GitHub\u2019s management team, and his wife no longer allowed into the company\u2019s offices. CEO Chris Wanstrath offered a public apology to Horvath for what she went through at the company; GitHub also launched an investigation which rejected Horvath\u2019s accusations of \u201cgender-based discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or abuse.\u201d This history bears mentioning in part because [hostile workplaces not only drive away talent, they increase](https://www.upguard.com/blog/why-ceo-approval-matters-for-security-ratings) [cybersecurity risk](https://www.upguard.com/blog/cybersecurity-risk)\u2013 risk for lost time, legal penalties, reputational damage, and data exposure. Read more about the whole sordid saga [here](https://github.blog/2014-04-21-results-of-the-github-investigation/), [here](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/) and [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/github-puts-founder-on-leave-kicks-wife-out-of-office-after-harassment-claim/).\nThe widespread use of GitHub by small developers for hosting their code has resulted in a well-tested platform that has one of the best user experience in the open-source community. Bitbucket, which did not start out with such a heavy focus on open source, and saw lower usage, has struggled at times with an interface that was seen as more complex to navigate than what GitHub offers. In recent times, though, this has changed. Bitbucket now draws rave reviews for its user experience. Its online editor is among the best for editing code directly online without checking it out onto your machine first. While not being the simplest platform to use, it\u2019s powerful and versatile, with plenty of features to support the needs of small businesses and enterprises who have long been heavy users of the platform. The Bitbucket interface is centered around the \u201cYour Work Dashboard,\u201d which gives you easy access to your repositories and pull requests. Bitbucket offers a fully-fledged Git interface and supports everything from filtering pull requests to issue tracking, management of SSH keys, and other features.\nGitHub has a simple interface that is friendly even for beginners to Git and online source code hosting. The platform has long been open-source friendly and packs a UI that provides access to Git\u2019s underlying features as well as providing some of its own. That said, there are scenarios where you will still need to know how to use Git at the command line, especially if you are managing large open source projects with complex merging requirements.\nGitHub lets you easily see and review commits by collaborators, with online diff features, so you can manage code at a granular level. The interface also offers excellent support for collaborative code review, highly useful for working in teams, tracking, and management of tasks, as well as DevOps features like CI/CD. Through its other tools such as GitHub Desktop, GitHub lets you expand the range of features you can use for managing your Git code collaboration still further.\nDeveloper adoption and community reach is one area where Bitbucket and GitHub have experienced diverging fortunes. Lacking the dominant position in open source that GitHub has long enjoyed, Bitbucket continues to play second fiddle to GitHub in terms of the number of users. However, its community has recorded impressive growth over the last several years.\nBitbucket now boasts [more than 10 million registered](https://bitbucket.org/blog/celebrating-10-million-bitbucket-cloud-registered-users) users, which, while not enough to supplant GitHub, which has been growing for its part as well, makes Bitbucket firmly one of the leaders in the online Git code hosting marketplace. Since the company\u2019s founding in 2008, its commitment to help companies write code, test software, and collaborate, has seen it grow to a level where it can claim that 60 of the Fortune 100 corporations use Bitbucket every single day. While it might have a smaller community than GitHub, Bitbucket is also notable for its plethora of integrations, which means its community can access tools like Slack, AWS, Datadog, and JFrog just as well as those developers using GitHub.\nGitHub\u2019s community is far more impressive, especially when it comes to its reputation in the open-source community. To be a credible open source project or open-source developer, it\u2019s almost a de facto standard that your code must be hosted and publicly available on GitHub. GitHub\u2019s user base now consists of [over 40 million registered users](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/14/github-launches-android-app-in-beta/), with over 100 million Git repositories hosted on the platform. GitHub\u2019s community is active in 200 countries and is a significant driver in the platform\u2019s preeminence in the tech world. This sizable community also drives business value and might have been a factor in [Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) back in 2018. While Microsoft and the open-source world had [long been at odds](https://jacquesmattheij.com/what-is-wrong-with-microsoft-buying-github/), the partnership between GitHub and Microsoft does give GitHub new-found credibility with enterprise customers, and Microsoft new-found credibility with open source developers and software users. Needless to say, the GitHub community, which already counts a good share of Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 companies, could continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the years ahead.\nIn addition to working with source code, both Bitbucket and GitHub serve as collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. Wikis and other tools for collaboration, built right into the platforms, help teams work collaboratively on ideas that form part of the intellectual space of the code. In Bitbucket, you get a wiki when you create a code repository. Bitbucket wikis can be edited and version controlled, and many projects also use them as project home pages.\nBitbucket offers plenty of other features that facilitate team collaboration, including side by side diffs, IDE integrations, and the ability to organize repositories into projects.\nGitHub also offers a plethora of collaboration features, with its history of facilitating very large open-source projects bearing testimony to the robustness of tools supporting collaboration on the platform. To name a few, some of the projects with the most influential collaborator networks and highest numbers of contributors include:\nThe GitHub workflow, with simple cloning, repository forking, branching, pull requests, merging, diffs, and more, makes this one of the best platforms for teams looking to work on code together, whether open source or not. GitHub also comes with support for wikis to document your project and share information with your team. Wikis are available for GitHub Free, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Wikis can be written in Markdown or other supported formats. Just as with source code, wikis are visible publicly for public repos, and limited to team members for private projects.\nOne of the chief selling points for Atlassian\u2019s Bitbucket is that it integrates extremely well with the Atlassian suite of developer tools, and these tools have considerable usage and are popular among developers. This is certainly true, and should be a factor in your consideration, however, note that GitHub has been making moves to buttress its products with similar features, and also integrates well with the Atlassian suite of developer tools.\nBitbucket integrates well with Jira, Atlassian\u2019s issue tracker software, and Trello, the project management tool that\u2019s popular among many software and business teams. In addition, there are more than 50 integrations with other commonly used developer tools available for developers and teams hosting their repositories on Bitbucket. These include:\nWith integrations, you are able to view metrics from these services and tools right inside Bitbucket, as well as managing aspects of your software or DevOps infrastructure right alongside the code.\nIf you do end up going with GitHub, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the integrations available for both Trello and Jira are very capable. In 2018, [GitHub announced it had been working with](https://github.blog/2018-10-04-announcing-the-new-github-and-jira-software-cloud-integration/) Jira to create an integration allowing enhanced features for connecting your GitHub code to Jira Software Cloud. Trello also has a GitHub Power Up integration that allows you to attach GitHub pull requests to Trello cards. Managing your GitHub work in Trello should be a breeze thanks to this integration. However, GitHub has been making moves to enhance its own product with Trello-like features. Back in 2016, for example, [GitHub launched \u201cProjects,](https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/github-launches-a-trello-competitor-pull-request-reviews-redesigned-profile-pages/)\u201d a feature allowing Trello-like cards to manage tasks and code projects.\nGitHub also has [integrations available](https://github.com/marketplace) for a wide range of popular developer tools and software products. A Slack integration is available for team chat, for example, as well as integrations with Codefresh and Semaphore for continuous integration. Monitoring integrations available include LogRocket and Waydev. In the project management category, integrations with GitKraken Glo Boards and DeepAffects are available, among plenty more useful integrations in multiple categories.\nGiven that both Bitbucket and GitHub are among the giants in the Git repository hosting space, it\u2019s likely they will continue to offer the widest sets of integrations with other popular code tools. A notable exception here is the [2020 dropping of Mercurial](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket) from Bitbucket\u2019s source code hosting services. GitHub never supported this VCS, but Bitbucket, for many years, did. However, due to the low numbers of Mercurial users, it has met a final demise on Bitbucket\u2019s platform and will not be supported in the future.\nThey may be the most visible and reputable Git hosting platforms available to developers today, but the popularity of Bitbucket and GitHub does not mean they are the only viable platforms available to you. Some low key longtime players have always been chugging along in the background and may receive more attention now that Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of GitHub, and other changes, have at least a small number of open-source developers asking questions.\nSince its appearance on the scene in 2011, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) has become a notable competitor to both GitHub and Bitbucket. Over the years, it has gone from offering source code management to a full DevOps lifecycle product. To quote the company\u2019s own web page, \u201cFrom project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application.\u201d\n[LaunchPad](https://launchpad.net/) is the software collaboration management platform used by Canonical, makers of the Ubuntu Linux distro and related software. Canonical is one of the big names in the open-source movement and its software management platform, with support for both Git and Bazaar, will be a great solution if you are working on open source code.\nAnother notable platform in the open-source world, [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) allows open source developers to host their code and distribute their software and downloads through the platform. It also has tools to import GitHub repositories along with related data such as wikis.\nThere are many other Git source code management and collaboration platforms that your team can use to develop software. Some notable ones to look at are [Google Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories) and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/). These tools also integrate well into cloud computing resources offered by their respective providers, Google and Amazon.\nBitbucket and GitHub are very closely matched in terms of features and either will be sufficient code repository hosting services if you need to use Git and or need a simple personal account. Both now have unlimited free private repositories. And if your version control system (VCS) is Mercurial, then it\u2019s only Bitbucket for you. Unfortunately, neither supports SVN, which remains popular. Each has some useful features not found in the other, such as GitHub pages for small web-hosting projects, or Bitbucket\u2019s JIRA integration.\nThe choice may come down to the structures of your projects. If you have many private projects and small numbers of users per project, Bitbucket may be a cheaper option because of its per-repo pricing. If you have large teams collaborating on just a few projects, GitHub may be the better option. The free plan offered by Bitbucket and GitHub is aimed at solo developers and small teams.\nSee how [UpGuard can help secure GitHub repositories](https://www.upguard.com/demo) and prevent dangerous data exposures.\nApart from pricing, the summary comparison table below may also help you in your decision:""

And we're moving by the way to a monthly cadence for stable releases as well. And when it comes to VS Code, just a couple of weeks ago, we shipped we shipped our hundth release in the open. It included improved multi-wind support and made it easier to view stage directly from within the editor. And GitHub continues to be the home for developers. GitHub enterprise has tremendous momentum in in the enterprise and we're doubling down for developers building any applications trust security compliance auditability data residency are even more critical today. Now starting with tools you use to the infrastructure you deploy on to reach the users and the markets you want. You know, talking about trust, opensource is at the core of GitHub and we're taking this next big step. As GitHub copilot has evolved inside VS Code, AI has become so central to how we code and that's why we're open sourcing C-Pilot in VS Code. We're really excited about this. You know, this is a big deal. Starting today, we will integrate these AI powered capabilities directly into the core of VS Code, bringing them into the same open-source repo that powers the most world's most loved uh dev tool. And of course, we'll continue to build out GitHub Copilot 2. In fact, over the past few years, we've gone from code completions to chat to multifile edits and now agents. And this same pattern is emerging more broadly across the agentic web. Uh you can ask questions and AI assistance give us answers. You can assign tasks to agents and have them execute them or work side by side with AI to complete jobs and projects. And you can mix and match all of these form factors, right? That's kind of what we care about as developers. It's not about any one of them. In fact, we're building app modernization right into agent mode, right? So, Copilot now is capable of upgrading frameworks like a Java 8 to 20 Java 21 or .NET 6 to .NET 9 and migrate any onremise app to the cloud. Uh, it creates a plan for your code and dependencies, suggests the fixes along the way, learns from changes you make, and makes the entire process seamless. And the next thing we're introducing is an autonomous agent for site reliability engineering or S sur, right? I mean, think about one of the biggest pain points for any of us, right? Getting woken up in the middle of the night to deal with a life side issue. Uh, take a pager duty, memory leak issue. Um the S sur agent starts automatically triaging root causing mitigating the issue and then it logs the incident management report as a GitHub issue with all the repair items. Uh and from there you can even assign the repair items uh to GitHub copilot and not we're not stopping there. This is the next big step forward which is a full coding agent built right into GitHub. Taking C-Pilot from being a pair programmer to a peer programmer. You can assign issues to Copilot bug fixes, new features, code maintenance, and it'll complete these tasks auto autonomously. And today I'm super excited that it's now available to all of you. You know, let me walk over. You know, gone are the days when I could just simply, you know, report bugs. At this point, I get to I'm assigned bugs to fix. And, you know, that's kind of called empowerment. Um and you know here I am uh with all the bugs that I have or issues that I have to deal with in uh GitHub issues. Uh the first one is adding a filter uh for user group size community page. Let's go take a look at this issue. Um it's nice. They say like I've got to go put some new filter up here. It also shows me where uh I guess it needs to do a range small, medium, large by size or some kind of a percentile. Um it's like some kind of a group by case when type of thing. So anyway, so let's do the thing that is easiest for me. Uh in fact, it even has some caching stuff which I have no idea what that is, but I guess there's a staging cache and then a readers. Okay, fine. Let's do the thing that I can do, which is assign it to my new buddy, co-pilot. So, I'm going to assign it. And um there you go. Let's go and see. Uh let me scroll down. Uh ah, it's picked it up. It sees me. It creates a PR. And uh you know, you see that lice eye emoji? It sort of knows that I'm here and it's sort of going on to work. and we'll come back and check it out later, right? It's just so fun, right? To be able to go take care of issues like that, like email triage assigned to co-pilot. Uh, you know, it's what what it's doing is it's setting up a branch. Uh, it starts uh GitHub actions in the sense it just generates the compute for you or creates a virtual machine using GitHub actions. uh it commits a draft PR to session logs and in fact you can go back to the session logs and continue to see all the the draft PRs as it's working.

Taking C-Pilot from being a pair programmer to a peer programmer. You can assign issues to Copilot bug fixes, new features, code maintenance, and it'll complete these tasks auto autonomously. And today I'm super excited that it's now available to all of you. You know, let me walk over. You know, gone are the days when I could just simply, you know, report bugs. At this point, I get to I'm assigned bugs to fix. And, you know, that's kind of called empowerment. Um and you know here I am uh with all the bugs that I have or issues that I have to deal with in uh GitHub issues. Uh the first one is adding a filter uh for user group size community page. Let's go take a look at this issue. Um it's nice. They say like I've got to go put some new filter up here. It also shows me where uh I guess it needs to do a range small, medium, large by size or some kind of a percentile. Um it's like some kind of a group by case when type of thing. So anyway, so let's do the thing that is easiest for me. Uh in fact, it even has some caching stuff which I have no idea what that is, but I guess there's a staging cache and then a readers. Okay, fine. Let's do the thing that I can do, which is assign it to my new buddy, co-pilot. So, I'm going to assign it. And um there you go. Let's go and see. Uh let me scroll down. Uh ah, it's picked it up. It sees me. It creates a PR. And uh you know, you see that lice eye emoji? It sort of knows that I'm here and it's sort of going on to work. and we'll come back and check it out later, right? It's just so fun, right? To be able to go take care of issues like that, like email triage assigned to co-pilot. Uh, you know, it's what what it's doing is it's setting up a branch. Uh, it starts uh GitHub actions in the sense it just generates the compute for you or creates a virtual machine using GitHub actions. uh it commits a draft PR to session logs and in fact you can go back to the session logs and continue to see all the the draft PRs as it's working. Our coding agent respects all the security measures while delivering a great developer experience. [Music] If you like the video do like, comment, share and subscribe.""
