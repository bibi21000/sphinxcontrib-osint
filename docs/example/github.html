Founding.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=2)]
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. [14] The site was launched in April 2008 by.
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner),
[Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath),
[P. J. Hyett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Hyett)and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as
a.

Its name was chosen as a compound of.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)hub.
[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-16)Structure of the organization.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=3)]
GitHub, Inc. was originally a [flat organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization) with no middle
managers, instead relying on [self-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management). [17] Employees
could choose to work on projects that interested them (
[open allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_allocation)), but the chief executive set salaries.
[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-nyt-18)In 2014, the company added a layer of [middle
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_management) in response to harassment allegations against its co-
founder and then-CEO, Thomas Preston-Werner, and his wife, Theresa Preston-Werner. As a result of the scandal, [Tom
Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner) resigned from his position as CEO. [19] Co-founder and
Product lead,
[Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath), became CEO.
[Julio Avalos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Avalos), then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed
control over GitHub&#39;s business operations and day-to-day management.
[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-20)Finance.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=4)]
GitHub was a [bootstrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship#Bootstrapping) [start-up
business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company), which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded
solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-21)
In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, [Andreessen
Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz) invested $100 million in [venture
capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) [9] with a $750 million valuation.
[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-22)In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of
venture capital in a [series B round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_B). The lead investor was [Sequoia
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital), and other investors were [Andreessen
Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz), [Thrive
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital), IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital
funds.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-23) [24] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.
[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-25)As of 2023, [update] GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue
annually.

The GitHub service was developed by [Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath), [P. J.
Hyett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Hyett), [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-
Werner), and Scott Chacon using [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails), and started in February
2008. [26] The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.
[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-27)On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being
online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At
that time, about 6,200 repositories had been [forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) at
least once, and 4,600 had been merged.
That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub, [28] and had grown to host 90,000 unique
public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.
[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-29)In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories. [30] A year later, this
number doubled.

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) command-line
interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public
[repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git
[plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) are also available. In addition, the site provides [social
networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [wiki
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software) called [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki)), and
a [social network graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graph) to display how developers work on their
versions (&quot;[forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))&quot;) of a repository and what fork (and
branch within that fork) is newest.
Anyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories.
With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others&#39;
repositories, and [review changes to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). GitHub began offering limited
private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public
repositories were free.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-71) [72]

Scope.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=9)]
The primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and
[issue tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) aspects of software development. Labels,
milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git
(and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the
source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In
Git terminology, this action is called &quot;committing&quot; and one instance of it is a &quot;commit.&quot; A history of all commits is
kept and can be viewed at a later time.
In addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:
- Documentation,
including automatically
rendered[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-75)[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)files in a variety
of[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-like file formats (see[README § On

launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting,
deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem.
GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for
self-managed build servers.
Gist.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=13)]
GitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code
snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for
larger projects. [15] Tom Preston-Werner débuted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.
[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a
[pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS
encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each &quot;gist&quot; is its own
Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using
Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)
Unregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users,
reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent
Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)
Gists&#39; [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page
with an option between a &quot;split&quot; and &quot;unified&quot; view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, &quot;starred&quot;, i.e., publicly
bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist
page.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)

[Crowdflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdflower), [DigitalOcean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean),
DNSimple, [HackHands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackHands), [Namecheap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecheap),
Orchestrate, Screenhero, [SendGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SendGrid),
[Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), [Travis CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI), and
[Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) to launch the
program.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104)
In 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program [105] to train and encourage students to grow
technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and
older worldwide.
GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus
Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To
become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community
leadership skills.

GitHub also provides some [software as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS)
integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:
- Waffle.io: project management for software teams, which allows users to automatically see pull requests, automated

GitHub Sponsors.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=16)]
GitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub. [110] The public beta was
announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations.
[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge)said that GitHub Sponsors &quot;works exactly like.
[Patreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon)&quot; because &quot;developers can offer various funding tiers that come with
different perks, and they&#39;ll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their
work&quot; except with &quot;zero fees to use the program.&quot; Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the
first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer.
Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.

Harassment allegations.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=20)]
In March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner engaged in a pattern
of [harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment) against her that led to her leaving the company. [117] In
April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath&#39;s allegations.
[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-118)
[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-NYTResigns-119)However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed
the claims. GitHub&#39;s CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, &quot;The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his
capacity as GitHub&#39;s CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints,
insensitivity to the impact of his spouse&#39;s presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his
spouse should not work in the office.&quot;
[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-120)Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.
[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Follow_up_to_the_investigation_results-121)The firm then announced it would
implement new initiatives and trainings &quot;to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=21)]
On July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that
GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed
that it was now blocking developers in.
[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran),
[Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea),
[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),
[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and.
[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.
However, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also
revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user&#39;s
account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:
[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full
compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub&#39;s vision is to be the global platform for.

examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required
by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and
accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]
Developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including
those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of
[VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP
proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history
and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)
Censorship.

On December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide
manuals. [128] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,
and GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.
[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-129)On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other

the block was lifted three days later.

ICE contract.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=23)]
GitHub has a $200,000 contract with [U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) for the use of their on-site
product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub
employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat
Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, &quot;The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and
not financially material for our company.&quot; He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to &quot;nonprofit groups
supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current
administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).&quot; [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub
employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses
by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,
five workers had resigned over the contract.

In 2012, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the original developer of Git, highly praised
GitHub, stating, &quot;The hosting of github [ sic] is excellent. They&#39;ve done a good job on that. I think GitHub should be
commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy.&quot; However, he also sharply criticized the
implementation of GitHub&#39;s merging interface, saying, &quot;Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but GitHub
instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version. As a result, I consider GitHub useless for these
kinds of things. It&#39;s fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit editing, are just pure garbage.&quot;

<summary>Text</summary><p>Title : Quickstart for GitHub Pages - GitHub Docs</p>
<p>Excerpt : You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your résumé. This guide will help get you started on creating your next website.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Introduction](https://docs-internal.github.com#introduction)
In this guide, you&#39;ll create a user site at &lt;username&gt;.github.io.
.
[Creating your website](https://docs-internal.github.com#creating-your-website)
-
In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click.
New repository. -
Enter.
username.github.io.
as the repository name. Replaceusername.
with your GitHub username. For example, if your username isoctocat.
, the repository name should beoctocat.github.io.
. -
Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see.
[About repositories](https://docs-internal.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-
repositories#about-repository-visibility). -
Select.
Initialize this repository with a README. -
Click.
Create repository. -
Under your repository name, click.
Settings. If you cannot see the &quot;Settings&quot; tab, select the dropdown menu, then clickSettings. -
In the &quot;Code and automation&quot; section of the sidebar, click.
Pages. -
Under &quot;Build and deployment&quot;, under &quot;Source&quot;, select.
Deploy from a branch. -
Under &quot;Build and deployment&quot;, under &quot;Branch&quot;, use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.
-
Optionally, open the.
README.md.
file of your repository. TheREADME.md.
file is where you will write the content for your site. You can edit the file or keep the default content for now. -
Visit.
username.github.io.
to view your new website. Note that it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the
changes to GitHub.
[Changing the title and description](https://docs-internal.github.com#changing-the-title-and-description)
By default, the title of your site is username.github.io.
. You can change the title by editing the _config.yml.
file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.
-
Click the.
Codetab of your repository. -
In the file list, click.
_config.yml.
to open the file. -
Click to edit the file.
-
The.
_config.yml.
file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line withtitle:
followed by the title you want. Add a new line withdescription:
followed by the description you want. For example:theme: jekyll-theme-minimal title: Octocat&#39;s homepage description:
Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!
-
When you are finished editing the file, click.
Commit changes.

Are there speaking opportunities at GitHub Universe?
Our Call for Sessions for Universe 2025 is now closed. Keep an eye out early next year for the Universe 2026 Call for
Sessions — we’re always excited to hear new voices and ideas from across the community.
Is there a hotel room block for GitHub Universe?
You bet! We’ve contracted with several hotels in the Fisherman’s Wharf area. Booking links will be available in your
[attendee portal](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal) after you complete registering
for the event.
Which airports are closest to San Francisco?
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is the closest major airport, an easy BART ride, or a 25-minute drive from
downtown. Alternatively, the Oakland International Airport (OAK) is a 35-minute drive over the Bay Bridge and is also
accessible by BART. Lastly, the San Jose International Airport (SJC) is a one-hour drive from the South Bay, accessible
by Caltrain.
What accessibility resources will be available at Universe?
We’re committed to making Universe as accessible and inclusive as possible. All sessions — with the exception of
Discussion Lounge, Sandbox sessions, and workshops — will have real-time captioning, and our main stage will include
American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation. We’ll also have dedicated onsite spaces for prayer and nursing parents.
Fort Mason is a historic venue that has been retrofitted to meet ADA standards, though some routes may take a bit longer
to navigate due to the layout of the space. If you have any specific accessibility needs or concerns, email us at
[universeaccessibility@github.com](mailto:universeaccessibility@github.com) — we’re here to help.
Where can I find information about and make adjustments to my registration details?
You can download a copy of your receipt and make modifications to your details (including pass cancellation) in your
registration profile in the [attendee portal](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal). If
you would like a confirmation email, please email: [events@github.com](mailto:events@github.com).
Who should I contact if I have special dietary needs or allergies?
We do our best to accommodate a wide range of dietary needs across all meals and snacks and will have options for vegan,
vegetarian, gluten-free, and dairy-free attendees. If you have a specific allergy or concern outside of this, email us
at [events@github.com](mailto:events@github.com) and we’ll do our best to support you.

    I designed and implemented control systems for various advanced driver assistance systems like Brake Assist Plus,
Pre-Safe Break, and Active Parking Assist. Brake Assist Plus and Pre-Safe Break were marquee features of the 2005
S-Class (W221) and 2006 CL-Class (C216).
    New to the S-Class: the PRE-SAFE brake.
      The new PRE-SAFE® brake from Mercedes-Benz represents a further milestone in car safety. The only system of its
kind in the world, it automatically brakes the car before an impending rear-end collision. As a result, the PRE-SAFE®
brake, in collaboration with Brake Assist PLUS, is able to prevent the collision or significantly reduce the severity of
the accident.

Founding.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=2)]
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. [14] The site was launched in April 2008 by.
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner),
[Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath),
[P. J. Hyett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Hyett)and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as
a.
[beta release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_release).
Its name was chosen as a compound of.
[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-pastie-15)and.
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)hub.
[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-16)Structure of the organization.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=3)]
GitHub, Inc. was originally a [flat organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization) with no middle
managers, instead relying on [self-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management). [17] Employees
could choose to work on projects that interested them (
[open allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_allocation)), but the chief executive set salaries.
[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-nyt-18)In 2014, the company added a layer of [middle
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_management) in response to harassment allegations against its co-
founder and then-CEO, Thomas Preston-Werner, and his wife, Theresa Preston-Werner. As a result of the scandal, [Tom
Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner) resigned from his position as CEO. [19] Co-founder and
Product lead,
[Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath), became CEO.
[Julio Avalos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Avalos), then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed
control over GitHub&#39;s business operations and day-to-day management.
[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-20)Finance.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=4)]
GitHub was a [bootstrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship#Bootstrapping) [start-up
business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company), which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded
solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-21)
In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, [Andreessen
Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz) invested $100 million in [venture
capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) [9] with a $750 million valuation.
[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-22)In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of
venture capital in a [series B round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_B). The lead investor was [Sequoia
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital), and other investors were [Andreessen
Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz), [Thrive
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital), IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital
funds.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-23) [24] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.
[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-25)As of 2023, [update] GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue
annually.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=5)]
The GitHub service was developed by [Chris Wanstrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wanstrath), [P. J.
Hyett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Hyett), [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-
Werner), and Scott Chacon using [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails), and started in February
2008. [26] The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.
[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-27)On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being
online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At
that time, about 6,200 repositories had been [forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) at
least once, and 4,600 had been merged.
That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub, [28] and had grown to host 90,000 unique
public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.
[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-29)In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories. [30] A year later, this
number doubled.
[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-31)[ReadWriteWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReadWriteWeb)reported that
GitHub had surpassed.
[SourceForge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge)and.
[Google Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code)in total number of commits for the period of January to May
2011.
On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.
[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-32)By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great,
reaching 10 million repositories.
[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-33)
[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-34)In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) command-line
interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public
[repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git
[plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) are also available. In addition, the site provides [social
networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking)-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [wiki
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software) called [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum_Wiki)), and
a [social network graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graph) to display how developers work on their
versions (&quot;[forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))&quot;) of a repository and what fork (and
branch within that fork) is newest.
Anyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories.
With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others&#39;
repositories, and [review changes to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). GitHub began offering limited
private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public
repositories were free.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-71) [72]

Scope.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=9)]
The primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and
[issue tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system) aspects of software development. Labels,
milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git
(and, by extension, GitHub) allows [pull requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request) to propose changes to the
source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In
Git terminology, this action is called &quot;committing&quot; and one instance of it is a &quot;commit.&quot; A history of all commits is
kept and can be viewed at a later time.
In addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:
- Documentation,
including automatically

launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions (e.g., testing, linting,
deployments). GitHub wanted to reduce reliance on third-party services and keep developers within the GitHub ecosystem.
GitHub Actions provided hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) that could dynamically scale, eliminating the need for
self-managed build servers.
Gist.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=13)]
GitHub also operates a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)-style site called Gist, which is for [code
snippets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)), as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for
larger projects. [15] Tom Preston-Werner débuted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.
[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100)Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a
[pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and [TLS
encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for private pastes. Because each &quot;gist&quot; is its own
Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using
Git.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)
Unregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users,
reportedly to mitigate [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) on the page of recent
Gists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)
Gists&#39; [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a [revision
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page
with an option between a &quot;split&quot; and &quot;unified&quot; view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, &quot;starred&quot;, i.e., publicly
bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist
page.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103)

On July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) that
GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages. [123] Soon after, GitHub confirmed
that it was now blocking developers in.

[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba),
[North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), and.
[Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria)from accessing private repositories.
However, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also
revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user&#39;s
account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:
[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124)GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full
compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub&#39;s vision is to be the global platform for.
[developer]collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to
examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required
by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and
accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.[[125]][[126]]
Developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including
those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of
[VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) and [IP
proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history
and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-127)

On December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide
manuals. [128] After a day, Russia withdrew its block,
and GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.

ICE contract.
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&amp;action=edit§ion=23)]
GitHub has a $200,000 contract with [U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) for the use of their on-site
product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub
employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO [Nat
Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman) stated, &quot;The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and
not financially material for our company.&quot; He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to &quot;nonprofit groups
supporting immigrant communities targeted by [the current
administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_presidency_of_Donald_Trump).&quot; [139] In response, at least 150 GitHub
employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses
by ICE. As of November 13, 2019,
five workers had resigned over the contract.

An open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the
company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The
letter has been signed by more than 700 people.

In January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the [January 6
United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack), calling some of the
rioters &quot;[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism)&quot;. [146] After an investigation, GitHub&#39;s COO said there were
&quot;significant errors of judgment and procedure&quot; with the company&#39;s decision to fire the employee. As a result of the
investigation, GitHub reached out to the employee, and the company&#39;s head of human resources resigned.

claimed that the postings infringed on copyright property owned by them, and asked the court for information to identify

In 2012, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the original developer of Git, highly praised
GitHub, stating, &quot;The hosting of github [ sic] is excellent. They&#39;ve done a good job on that. I think GitHub should be
commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy.&quot; However, he also sharply criticized the
implementation of GitHub&#39;s merging interface, saying, &quot;Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but GitHub
instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version. As a result, I consider GitHub useless for these
kinds of things. It&#39;s fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit editing, are just pure garbage.&quot;

all dispatches. world of software, and in particular free and open software. Github, the reference platform for
developers around the world, was bought by the American net giant Microsoft, known for its software suite -Forée-
Windows. After several days of rumors, the Redmond firm confirmed the acquisition, for an amount of $ 7.5 billion (6.4
billion euros). The transaction must be carried out by Microsoft actions and should be finalized at the end of the year
after the green light from the regulatory authorities. Created in 2008, Github is certainly not very well known to the
general public, but it still claims more than 28 million users worldwide. Bible of developers, it is a platform that
allows them to publish and share, in a completely open way if they wish, the code they have created. Github is now
hosting more than 80 million projects: software of course, but also any other computer program (site, mobile
application), without limitation of programming language. Opening and the spirit of sharing that reigns in its community
of users have logically transformed Github into one of the flagship platforms of supporters of free software. The latter
promote the transparency of software thanks to the publication of the entire source code, which allows anyone to have
access to it, to be able to modify it to enrich it, or to use certain parts to create another software. With free
software, a user can for example adapt the program to the use he makes of it, which offers him flexibility. Free
software is also supported by defenders of freedoms on the net because its transparency is deemed democratic -Chacun can
understand the actions and decisions of the program -. It is also considered to be safer, because developers can
identify if the code has been altered by a stolen door - a flaw used in particular by intelligence services - or a
cybercriminal. So, the culture of free claims transparency, sharing and often free. It is opposed with most players in
the software industry, who create and market owner or closed software, that is to say, the source code of which is kept
secret to prevent us from copying or modifying it. Microsoft, the third world market capitalization behind Apple and
Amazon, is the largest symbol with its owner suite Windows, which has made its richness. The announcing of Github&#39;s
buyout by Microsoft therefore gives some cold sweats in the world of free software, both disappointed and worried. His
supporters fear that the giant of Redmond does not distort the concept of Github, in particular his collaborative
approach, that he locks his flexibility of use or that he is trying to take advantage of it. In a press release,
Microsoft wanted to be reassuring. For the American company, the acquisition will allow developers to have new tools at
each stage of software development, which will allow them to provide new services to their users:
Should we see in this redemption the destruction of a symbol of free software, or on the contrary its recognition by one
of the major players in the software industry? In recent years, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has been changing
the group to the cloud and artificial intelligence, and has multiplied the statements favorable to the development of
free software. Even if Windows and the services in the cloud -Logiciales and accommodation - draw most of the group&#39;s
income, Microsoft has thus started a rapprochement to the culture of free software. It offers for example the operating
system open Linux. To read also. The most read projects.
