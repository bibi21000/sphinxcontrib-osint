OSInt documentation
===================

This is the official documentation of **sphinxcontrib-osint**.

It allows you to store and organize data grabbed during your Open Source Intelligence quest.

Organisations, peoples and events can be added and the relations between them.
You can generate some reports, graphs and analyses with these data.

For the **impatient**, take a look at `example <example/index.html>`_ quest.

For the **first time user**, `install <install.html>`_ sphinxcontrib-osint and create your first quest.
After you can add data to your `quest <quest.html>`_ and some `reports <report.html>`_.

For the **experencied one**, look at `directives <directives.html>`_ details
and `plugins <plugins.html>`_.

For the **developpers**, you can contact me or look at `plugins code <https://github.com/bibi21000/sphinxcontrib-osint/tree/main/sphinxcontrib/osint/plugins>`_
to see how to extend sphinxcontrib-osint.
